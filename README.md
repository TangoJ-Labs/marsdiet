## Eat like a Martian.

This project is an open-source collaboration for individuals to find tasty, sustainable diets that will likely exist in off-world colonies.  Try it out - you'll find it to be quite healthy (and yummy).

Push recommendations and corrections whenever you have input - we're all learning this together.

The organization of the diets and recipes will likely shuffle during the early stages of this repo, so please browse around - you might find some hidden kernels of delectableness.
